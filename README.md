# Road-accident-analysis
The primary aim of creating this Power BI dashboard is to delve into road accident data with the goal of uncovering meaningful insights that can contribute to enhancing road safety measures. Our journey began by importing the accident data into Power BI and meticulously refining it to ensure its accuracy and reliability for subsequent analysis. This dataset encompasses a wealth of information about various accidents, including details such as the number of vehicles involved, the severity of the accidents, as well as the specific locations and timestamps of these incidents.

In this project, we've harnessed the power of data visualization through six distinct types of graphs, each tailored to showcase different aspects of the data. This approach enables us to effectively visualize and compare scenarios across a variety of factors. By segmenting the data based on different road surface conditions and prevailing weather, we're able to gain insights into how these elements correlate with accident occurrences. The dashboard's interface allows us to easily discern critical details, such as the overall casualties—both fatal and non-fatal. Moreover, it classifies accidents based on whether they transpired in rural or urban settings, providing an additional layer of conteext.

Furthermore, our analysis extends to the types of vehicles involved, shedding light on which vehicle categories are more commonly associated with accidents. This holistic approach to examining the data empowers us to uncover trends and relationships that can drive informed decisions and interventions aimed at promoting road safety.

In summary, the Power BI dashboard we've developed acts as a comprehensive window into the world of road accidents, offering a user-friendly platform to explore and understand the intricate dynamics that influence accident occurrences. Through meaningful visualizations and thoughtful categorizations, we strive to contribute to the ongoing efforts to make our roads safer for everyone.
